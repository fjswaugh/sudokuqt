- Board should not be stored as one object with two grids
- There should be a grid class, with the mainwindow holding two: one to
    display as output, and one that is updated as data is inputed.
- Currently there is an issue with copying as a result of this... Copy input
    board fetches the input into m_board, however this clears the output grid
    (it doesn't really make much sense to have one board class where the output
    grid data doesn't match the input). It doesn't clear the output view
    though. Hence subsequently copying the output simply copies a blank grid.
